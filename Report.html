        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> In this assignment, I discussed my aspirations for the next 10 years and how I planned to present them on the website in a way that would pique the viewer's interest and curiosity. The website design, with its adventurous background and unique font, reflects my creative and professional sides. It is meant to encourage the viewer to explore the portfolio and discover what it has to offer.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My goal is to draw employers' attention by giving them a clear and concise picture of who I am.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> The portfolio was the first one I looked at. I saw a basic yet effective style in that portfolio, with little writing where it is unnecessary and a lot of text when it is necessary. .</li>    
          <li> The  Theory portfolio was the second portfolio I had looked at, and I thought it was wonderful since it was clear that a lot of effort had gone into it. I also learned about animation from it and realised that my website required some animations. The continual shift in the toys used as the background for the words in the Toyfight portfolio makes it incredibly imaginative, and it stands out to me as a very clever use of the website name. When you open the website, you notice a mountainous landscape, which draws attention to the three descriptors on the homepage. I used this to highlight my title.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Planning</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Making it color-viewable is one accessibility feature I've utilised to make it apparent what the language and photos represent thanks to the writing's colour. </li>
          <li>Making effective use of HTML headers is another accessibility feature I've employed. This is due to the navigation buttons, which when you click them, send you to the pages that correspond to their names. For example, clicking the about button will take you to the about me page, while clicking the contact button will take you to the contact me page.</li>
          <li>Additionally, another aspect I have used in terms of accessibility is the media support so if you were to view it on a mobile you can easily navigate similar to navigating in terms of the different pages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My website is very easy to navigate as to switch pages all you have to do is press the nav buttons (home, about, contact).</p>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>What I have learnt from doing this website: 
          <br> Through doing this website I have learnt many things from styling classes from HTML in CSS and how to actual change styling, as now I have a more in-depth amount of knowledge in terms of how to code in terms of HTML and CSS.
          Also I have understood how to structure CSS on brackets as well as HTML.</p>
        <p>Libraries and other resources
          <br>
            Although, I have used many of these websites to guide me the website i found the most useful was the "w3schools" website as it guided me throughtout the layouts of the page.

        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>What worked well</h3>
            <p> I think the HTML and CSS for my website were successful. I am particularly pleased with the layout of each page. I am proud of the HTML and CSS aspect of my website.
            </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Improved</h3>
            <p>I think the Javascript needs improvement because I didn't have time to include it due to illness. I attempted to add it to my nav bar, but it caused issues. As a result, I focused on completing the website and forgot to add Javascript. To improve this assignment, I should have incorporated Javascript sooner to meet the deadline.
